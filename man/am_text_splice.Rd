\title{Splice text in a text object}
\usage{
am_text_splice(text_obj, pos, del_count, text)
}
\arguments{
\item{text_obj}{An Automerge text object ID}

\item{pos}{Character position to start splice (0-based, counts Unicode code points)}

\item{del_count}{Number of characters to delete (counts Unicode code points)}

\item{text}{Text to insert}
}
\value{
The text object \code{text_obj} (invisibly)
}
\description{
Insert or delete characters in a text object. This is the primary way to
edit text CRDT objects.
}
\details{
Text positions use character (Unicode code point) indexing, matching R's
\code{substr()} and \code{nchar()} behavior. For example, in "Hello😀", the emoji
is at position 5 (as a single character), not byte offset 5-8.

This means \code{nchar("😀")} returns 1, and you can use that directly in
text operations without needing to calculate byte offsets.
}
\examples{
doc <- am_create()
text_obj <- am_put(doc, AM_ROOT, "doc", am_text("Hello"))

# Insert " World" at position 5 (after "Hello")
am_text_splice(text_obj, 5, 0, " World")

# Get the full text
am_text_get(text_obj)  # "Hello World"

# Works naturally with multibyte characters
text_obj2 <- am_put(doc, AM_ROOT, "emoji", am_text(""))
am_text_splice(text_obj2, 0, 0, "Hello😀")
# Position 5 is the emoji (character index, not bytes)
am_text_splice(text_obj2, 6, 0, "World")
am_text_get(text_obj2)  # "Hello😀World"
}
