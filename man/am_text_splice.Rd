\title{Splice text in a text object}
\usage{
am_text_splice(text_obj, pos, del_count, text)
}
\arguments{
\item{text_obj}{An Automerge text object ID}

\item{pos}{Character position to start splice (0-based inter-character position)}

\item{del_count}{Number of characters to delete (counts Unicode code points)}

\item{text}{Text to insert}
}
\value{
The text object \code{text_obj} (invisibly)
}
\description{
Insert or delete characters in a text object. This is the primary way to
edit text CRDT objects.
}
\section{Indexing Convention}{

\strong{Text positions use 0-based indexing} (unlike list indices which are
1-based). This is because positions specify locations \strong{between} characters,
not the characters themselves:
\itemize{
\item Position 0 = before the first character
\item Position 1 = between 1st and 2nd characters
\item Position 5 = after the 5th character
}

For the text "Hello":
\preformatted{
  H e l l o
 0 1 2 3 4 5  <- positions (0-based, between characters)
}

Positions count Unicode code points (characters), not bytes. The emoji "😀"
counts as 1 character, matching R's \code{nchar()} behavior.

\examples{
doc <- am_create()
am_put(doc, AM_ROOT, "doc", am_text("Hello"))
text_obj <- am_get(doc, AM_ROOT, "doc")

# Insert " World" at position 5 (after "Hello")
am_text_splice(text_obj, 5, 0, " World")

# Get the full text
am_text_get(text_obj)  # "Hello World"

# Works naturally with multibyte characters
am_put(doc, AM_ROOT, "emoji", am_text(""))
text_obj2 <- am_get(doc, AM_ROOT, "emoji")
am_text_splice(text_obj2, 0, 0, "Hello😀")
# Position 5 is the emoji (character index, not bytes)
am_text_splice(text_obj2, 6, 0, "World")
am_text_get(text_obj2)  # "Hello😀World"
}
