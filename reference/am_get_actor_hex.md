# Get the actor ID as a hex string

Returns the actor ID of an Automerge document as a hex-encoded string.
This is more efficient than converting the raw bytes returned by
[`am_get_actor()`](http://shikokuchuo.net/automerge-r/reference/am_get_actor.md)
using R-level string operations.

## Usage

``` r
am_get_actor_hex(doc)
```

## Arguments

- doc:

  An Automerge document

## Value

A character string containing the hex-encoded actor ID

## Examples

``` r
doc <- am_create()
actor_hex <- am_get_actor_hex(doc)
cat("Actor ID:", actor_hex, "\n")
#> Actor ID: 85fd19716b8d4a76264c9a81949d07cf 
```
