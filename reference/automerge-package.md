# automerge: R Bindings for Automerge CRDT Library

Provides R bindings to the Automerge Conflict-free Replicated Data Type
(CRDT) library via its C FFI. Automerge enables automatic merging of
concurrent changes without conflicts, making it ideal for distributed
systems, collaborative applications, and offline-first architectures.
The package supports all Automerge data types (maps, lists, text,
counters) and provides both low-level and high-level synchronization
protocols for seamless interoperability with JavaScript and other
Automerge implementations.
