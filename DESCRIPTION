Description: Provides R bindings to the Automerge Conflict-free Replicated
    Data Type (CRDT) library via its C FFI. Automerge enables automatic
    merging of concurrent changes without conflicts, making it ideal for
    distributed systems, collaborative applications, and offline-first
    architectures. The package supports all Automerge data types (maps,
    lists, text, counters) and provides both low-level and high-level
    synchronization protocols for seamless interoperability with
    JavaScript and other Automerge implementations.
